# Abstract

You are not an object-oriented programmer! OK, maybe you are sometimes, but sometimes you only *think* you've got encapsulation, isolation, modularity, inheritance, testability but you really don't! Monkeys play with stuff and solve problems and have lots of fun, but aren't very safe; Robots send messages and accept commands, and are efficient but often difficult.

# Instructions

Alex has been working on Scott Chacon's Showoff app; you will have to download and install his version, as follows:

    git clone git://github.com/alexch/showoff.git
    cd showoff
    bundle install --without optional
    rake gem:install
    
After installing, run

    showoff serve .

This will launch a local Sinatra server on port 9090. Open your browser to `localhost:9090`. On a Mac you can run:

    open http://localhost:9090
