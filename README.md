# Instructions

Alex has been improving showoff; until his latest patches get accepted and released, you will have to download and install his version, as follows:

    git clone git://github.com/alexch/showoff.git
    cd showoff
    bundle install --without optional
    rake gem:install
    
After installing, run

    showoff serve .

This will launch a local Sinatra server on port 9090. Open your browser to `localhost:9090`. On a Mac you can run:

    open http://localhost:9090
